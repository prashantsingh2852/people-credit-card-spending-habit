1. write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends 

with total_sales as 
(select sum(amount) as total_sum from credit_card_transactions)
select cct.city, 
sum(amount) as city_wise_amt,
round(sum(amount) / total_sales.total_sum *100,1) as pert_contribution
from credit_card_transactions cct
join total_sales on 1=1
group by cct.city, total_sales.total_sum
order by 2 desc 
limit 5

2. write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type

select * from credit_card_transactions cct 


select distinct card_type,
mon_year,
total_spend 
from
(select *,
row_number () over (partition by card_type order by total_spend desc) as rn
from

date_format(trans_date,'%b-%Y') as mon_year,
sum(amount) as total_spend
from credit_card_transactions cct 
group by 1,2) xn2) xn3
where rn = 1

3. Write a query to print the transaction details(all columns from the table) for each card type when
it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends(We should have 4 rows in the o/p one for each card type)

select * from 
(select *,
row_number () over (partition by card_type order by cum_sales) as rn 
from
(select * from 
(select *,
sum(amount) over (partition by card_type order by trans_date, amount) as cum_sales
from credit_card_transactions cct) cct1
where cum_sales >=1000000
order by 8) cct2) cct3
where rn = 1

4. write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type

with city_sum_gold as
(select city, sum(amount) as city_gold
from credit_card_transactions
where card_type = 'gold'
group by 1),
city_total_sum as 
(select city, sum(amount) as city_total
from credit_card_transactions
group by 1)
select *,
city_sum_gold.city_gold,
city_total_sum.city_total,
round(city_sum_gold.city_gold / city_total_sum.city_total *100,2) as perct_contribution
from city_sum_gold
join city_total_sum
on city_sum_gold.city = city_total_sum.city
order by 7
limit 1

5. write a query to print 3 columns: city, highest_expense_type , lowest_expense_type (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel)

select city ,
min(case when max_exp_type = amount then exp_type end) as highest_expense_type,
min(case when min_exp_type = amount then exp_type end) as lowest_expense_type
from
(select city,
exp_type,
amount ,
max(amount) over (partition by city) as max_exp_type,
min(amount) over (partition by city) as min_exp_type 
from credit_card_transactions) cct1
group by 1
order by 1

6. write a query to find percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type

with cte1 as
(select exp_type,
sum(amount) as total_sum
from credit_card_transactions cct
group by 1),
cte2 as
(select exp_type,
sum(amount) as female_total_sum
from credit_card_transactions cct2 
where gender = 'f'
group by 1)
select cte1.exp_type,
female_total_sum / total_sum * 100 as pert_contribution
from cte1
join cte2
on cte1.exp_type = cte2.exp_type

7. which card and expense type combination saw highest month over month growth in Jan-2014

with cte1 as 
(select distinct concat(card_type,' ',exp_type) as combo,
sum(amount) over (partition by card_type, exp_type) as combo_sum_dec
from credit_card_transactions cct 
where date_format(trans_date,'%b-%Y') = 'Dec-2013'),
cte2 as
(select distinct concat(card_type,' ',exp_type) as combo,
sum(amount) over (partition by card_type, exp_type) as combo_sum_jan
from credit_card_transactions cct 
where date_format(trans_date,'%b-%Y') = 'Jan-2014')
select cte1.combo,
combo_sum_dec,
combo_sum_jan,
(combo_sum_jan - combo_sum_dec) / combo_sum_dec * 100 as mom_growth
from cte1
join cte2
on cte1.combo = cte2.combo
order by 4 desc

8. which city took least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after first transaction in that city

with cte1 as
(select * from
(select *,
row_number () over (partition by city order by trans_date) as min_day
from credit_card_transactions) ct1
where min_day = 1),
cte2 as 
(select * from
(select *,
row_number () over (partition by city order by trans_date) as max_day
from credit_card_transactions) ct1
where max_day = 500),
cte3 as
(select cte1.city,
case when min_day = 1 then cte1.trans_date end as start_date,
case when max_day = 500 then cte2.trans_date end as end_date
from cte1
join cte2
on cte1.city = cte2.city)
select cte3.city,
datediff(end_date,start_date) as diff_days
from cte3
order by 2
